Expensify app from Andrew Mead's course: https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/

I added the following features after the course:

 - Multiple Sign in options
 - I added a secondary totals summary
 - I created a reusable modal, which I used for confirming logout and confirming removing of an expense

 If you want to clone and add a feature, feel free and the pull request and I can figure out how to merge that...
